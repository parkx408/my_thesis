\section{Plackett-Burman designs}
\label{BG_PB}
The \emph{Plackett-Burman design} (PB design)~\cite{plackett:1946} minimizes the number of experiments required to estimate the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable. 
Basically, it estimates the effect of single input parameter on an output in such a way that variance of this effect due to other inputs is minimized. 
The effect is an approximation of the full factorial design but with linear complexity. 
Required assumption is that higher order interaction effects are negligible. 
PB design has been widely used to evaluate effect of benchmark input parameters on processor performance~\cite{yi:2003} and database query processing performance~\cite{debnath:2008}, for example.

Formally, the main effect  $m_1$ of input variable $x_1$ on output $y$ is defined to be 
\begin{equation}
m_1 = \frac{[\sum f(x'_1, x_2, ..., x_n)-\sum f(\overline{x_1}, x_2, ..., x_n)]}{2^n}
\end{equation}
where $x'_1$ represents some extreme value of $x_1$ and $\overline{x_1}$ represents the mean of $x_1$. 
$f$ is an unknown function which maps all $x_i$ to $y$. 
The summation is carried out for all possible combination of $x_2$ through $x_n$. 
Hence, the effect of $x_i$ is simply maximum deviation of $y$ given maximum deviation of $x_i$. 

The goal of PB design is to estimate all $m_i$s such that
\begin{equation}
S=\sum\limits_j (\widehat{y_j}-M-a_{j1}m_1-a_{j2}m_{2}...-a_{jn}m_n+\alpha)^2
\end{equation}
is minimized. 
$\widehat{y_j}$ is simply the sampled value of $y$ at time $j$ and $M$ is mean value of all $y_j$s. 
$a_{ji}$ takes value $\pm 1$ based on whether the $x_i$ had positive or negative effect on $\widehat{y_j}$. 
$\alpha$ is the higher order effects which are ignored based on the observations made by Fisher~\cite{fisher:1936}. 
Since there are $n$ values to be estimated, the minimum number of experiments required to derive a unique set of $m_i$ is $n+1$. 
Plackett and Burman proved that $S$ can indeed be minimized using $\lceil(n+1)/4\rceil*4$ experiments assuming $\alpha = 0$~\cite{plackett:1946}.
