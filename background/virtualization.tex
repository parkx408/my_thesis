\section{Storage Virtualization}
\label{VIRT}

The term \emph{storage virtualization} can be applied very broadly. 
In fact, any type of IO indrection to provide a virtual block address space can be seen as a type of virtualization.

In this work, we focus on the storage virtualization where a single storage unit provides a multiple volumns through distributed locking mechanism and IO redirection~\cite{vaghani:2010, gupta:2011, soltis:1996}.

We have used VMware's VSphere 5.1 as our test platform~\cite{vmware:2013} and will describe how it virtualizes its storage stack in this section.

\subsection{Architecture}
There are two main functional components required for storage virtualization.
The first is the command translation and the second is the address mapping. 

In case of VMware's VSpere platform, default underlying mechanism is called VMFS~cite{vaghani:2010}.
